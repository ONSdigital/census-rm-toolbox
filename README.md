# Census RM Toolbox

The most bestestest tools for make running the census big success wow.

## Batched reminder scheduling
To comply with a limit on the number of cases we can send for reminder print materials in one day, some reminder runs are split into batches and spread in a wave over multiple days. 
To ensure we maximize our use of said limit, we need to maximize how many batches of cases we include in each day of this wave. The reminder batching script in this repo counts the cases that would be included from each batch and adds them to a rolling total, pulling batches in until the limit is hit.
The script can then just output the classifiers including these batches, or insert the action rules for them itself depending on the options it is run with.

### Running the reminder batch scheduler
#### Without setting up action rules
This is useful to get preliminary counts of the cases included.

Run the script with 
```bash 
reminderbatch -w <WAVE_NUMBER> -b <STARTING_BATCH_NUMBER> -a <ACTION_PLAN_ID>
```
This should output the case count for each print batch until it hits the max.

#### Setting up the action rules
**WARNING:** This will insert the action rules into the action database. Be sure you want to schedule these materials for print.

Run the script with the `--insert-rules` flag.

The `--trigger-date-time` also become necessary to schedule the rule correctly.
The trigger date time must be supplied in [rfc3339 format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339).
```bash
reminderbatch -w <WAVE_NUMBER> -b <STARTING_BATCH_NUMBER> -a <ACTION_PLAN_ID> --insert-rules --trigger-date-time=<DATE_TIME>
```
Once the script succeeds the action rules should be present in the action database. 

**IMPORTANT:** The output should tell you the final batch included, you may need to keep this in order to start from the next batch the following day.

#### Specifying max cases
The max cases for a day defaults to 2,500,000. You may need to lower this limit to compensate for other print materials that day.
Use the flag `--max-cases <MAX_CASES>`

e.g.
```bash
reminderbatch -w <WAVE_NUMBER> -b <STARTING_BATCH_NUMBER> -a <ACTION_PLAN_ID> --max-cases 2000000
```
```bash
reminderbatch -w <WAVE_NUMBER> -b <STARTING_BATCH_NUMBER> -a <ACTION_PLAN_ID> --insert-rules --trigger-date-time=<DATE_TIME> --max-cases=1000000 
```

## Response-driven reminder scheduling
We can create response-driven action rules from a provided CSV file of LSOAs from a bucket. You will need to copy this file from the bucket to your cloud project, then copy to the running toolbox instance.

#### Get counts of cases for response-driven reminders
To get a count of cases using the LSOAs file:
```bash
reminderlsoacount <LSOA_FILE.CSV> --action-plan-id <ACTION_PLAN_ID>
```

#### Without setting up action rules
This is useful to get the shape of what the classifiers will look like when used in the action rule.

Run the script with:
```bash 
reminderlsoa <LSOA_FILE.CSV> --reminder-action-type <ACTION_TYPE> --action-plan-id <ACTION_PLAN_ID>
```
This should output the classifiers used for the action rule.

#### Setting up the action rules
**WARNING:** This will insert the action rules into the action database. Be sure you want to schedule these materials for print.

**WARNING:** There is currently NO validation on the LSOAs file. You will need to be sure that the business area have validated the LSOAs for RM to ingest. We will process whatever they provide, as agreed.
Run the script with the `--trigger-date-time` and `--insert-rule` flags. The trigger date time must be supplied in [rfc3339 format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339):

```bash
reminderlsoa <LSOA_FILE.CSV> --reminder-action-type <ACTION_TYPE> --action-plan-id <ACTION_PLAN_ID> --trigger-date-time <DATE_TIME> --insert-rule 
```
Once the script succeeds the action rule should be present in the action database.

## Bulk Processing
### Bulk Refusals
Bulk refusals files can be dropped in a bucket for processing, the file format required is 
```csv
case_id,refusal_type
16400b37-e0fb-4cf4-9ddf-728abce92049,HARD_REFUSAL
180e2636-d8e5-4949-bced-f7a0c532190c,EXTRAORDINARY_REFUSAL
```
Including the header row.

The refusal type must be one of 
```
HARD_REFUSAL
EXTRAORDINARY_REFUSAL
```

The file should be placed in the configured bulk refusals bucket with a name matching `refusals_*.csv`, then the processor can be run with
```shell script
bulkrefusals
```
Rows which are successfully processed will be added to `PROCESSED_refusals_*.csv` and errored rows be appended to `ERROR_refusals_*.csv` with the corresponding error details written to `ERROR_DETAIL_refusals_*.csv`.

### Bulk New Addresses
Bulk new addresses can be dropped in a bucket for processing, the file format required is
```csv
UPRN,ESTAB_UPRN,ADDRESS_TYPE,ESTAB_TYPE,ADDRESS_LEVEL,ABP_CODE,ORGANISATION_NAME,ADDRESS_LINE1,ADDRESS_LINE2,ADDRESS_LINE3,TOWN_NAME,POSTCODE,LATITUDE,LONGITUDE,OA,LSOA,MSOA,LAD,REGION,HTC_WILLINGNESS,HTC_DIGITAL,TREATMENT_CODE,FIELDCOORDINATOR_ID,FIELDOFFICER_ID,CE_EXPECTED_CAPACITY,CE_SECURE,PRINT_BATCH

```

This follows the same validation rules as the sample loader.

To process the file it needs to be put in the bulk new addresses bucket with a name matching `new_addresses_*.csv`. The processor can then be run with
```shell script
bulknewaddresses
```

Rows which are successfully processed will be added to `PROCESSED_new_addresses_*.csv` and errored rows be appended to `ERROR_new_addresses_*.csv` with the corresponding error details written to `ERROR_DETAIL_new_addresses_*.csv`.

To process the file it needs to be put in the bulk address update bucket with a name matching `address_updates_*.csv`. The processor can then be run with
```shell script
bulkaddressupdate
```

Rows which are successfully processed will be added to `PROCESSED_address_updates_*.csv` and errored rows be appended to `ERROR_address_updates_*.csv` with the corresponding error details written to `ERROR_DETAIL_address_updates_*.csv`.

### Find Invalid Address Case IDs from UPRN File
Run Book - https://collaborate2.ons.gov.uk/confluence/display/SDC/Find+Invalid+Address+Case+ID%27s+by+UPRN+-+ADDRESS_DELTA

When we receive a file of UPRNs for cases that have been identified as invalid addresses, this feature will call the Case API against the UPRNs provided and generate a new file in the bulk invalid address bucket and run the bulk processor against the file.

This is done by running:
```shell script
invalidaddressdelta <file_name>
```

The rows which are successfully processed will be added to `PROCESSED_invalid_addresses_*.csv`

The file format will be:
```csv
case_id,reason
16400b37-e0fb-4cf4-9ddf-728abce92049,ADDRESS_DELTA
180e2636-d8e5-4949-bced-f7a0c532190c,ADDRESS_DELTA
```
Including the header row. The reason given will always be `ADDRESS_DELTA`.


## Questionnaire Linking
On dev-toolbox run
```bash
qidlink <filename.csv>
```


## Bad Message Wizard
On the pod run
```bash
msgwizard
```

This should start a terminal wizard for dealing with bad messages through the exception manager service

## Running in Kubernetes
To run the toolbox in a kubernetes environment, you'll have to create the deployment using the YAML files in census-rm-kubernetes. If you do not have a Cloud SQL Read Replica, use the dev deployment YAML file

Once the pod is up, you can connect to it:
```bash
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods --selector=app=census-rm-toolbox -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}') -- /bin/bash
```
